# LiftMaster MyQ for HomeSeer HS3

This is a free, open-source plugin to control LiftMaster-branded MyQ garage doors and gates. It may also work with other
brands of MyQ openers, but has only been tested on a LiftMaster 8355W opener.

It should work with any opener that can be controlled by the
[MyQ Garage & Access Control app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chamberlain.android.liftmaster.myq).
